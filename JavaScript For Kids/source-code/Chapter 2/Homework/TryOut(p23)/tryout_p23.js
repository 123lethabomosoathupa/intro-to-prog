//Question 1

var balloons = 100; //we are declaring the variable "balloons" and assigning it with the value of 100
balloons *= 2;      //we are multiplying the value of balloons by 2
200                 //This is the result that is given from that operation

//Question 2

var balloons = 100; //we are declaring the variable "balloons" and assigning it with the value of 100
balloons /= 4;      //we are dividing the value of the balloons by 4
25                  //This is the result of the given operation
